# Javascript-Randomizer-Assignement
This assignment focused on getting comfortable with Javascript. Within this assignment we were asked to create multiple functions each of which contribute to the randomization of images on a website.
By using Javascript functions and the Bootstrap framework, we were asked to randomize images every number of seconds, and allow the user to change the number of seconds until randmoization.
I achieved 100% on this assignment.
